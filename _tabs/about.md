Welcome to where I'll write up things as I learn. I've tried using other platforms like Wordpress and Medium in the past to keep track of things, but I was always paranoid that somehow the data would get lost and then it couldn't be recovered. Now I'm giving Git and Github Pages a shot. Even if Github crashes and data is lost, I'll have a copy on my machine and will be able to redeploy to another server.

Additionally, I can work on several different posts/projects at once and progressively build a post by creating commits which can also work as an auto documentation of my progress and different steps for building and creating things. Now that that's out of the way...

I really like experimenting and am definitely drawn more towards STEM topics and that's what you'll mostly find here. I want to document things not just for me to reference later but also to serve as a reference point for others starting on a project that might be similar to one I've done. No need to reinvent the wheel.

Outside of my nerd hobbies and job, I tinker around the house and am working on getting back into shape.

Talk to you guys later, peace!
